# Schelling model
This is the basic Schelling model with just python (and numpy)

More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation

requirement (as the testing machine):
python 3.7.9
numpy 1.19.2

## How to run?

Call the function 
```py
simulation(P = ,iter = ,t = )
```
where `P` is the probability array, `iter` is the iteration that we want it to run, and `t` for threshold or tolerance.

Full version of code will be upload after assignment deadline to prevent plagiarism. The code right here is the dummy code and it will be obvious if you copy my code to finish the assignment.
