# Schelling-model
This is the basic Schelling model with just python (and numpy)

requirement (as the testing machine):
python 3.7.9
numpy 1.19.2

How to run?

Call the function 
```py
simulation(P = ,iter = ,t = )
```
where `P` is the probability array, `iter` is the iteration that we want it to run, and `t` for threshold or tolerance.
